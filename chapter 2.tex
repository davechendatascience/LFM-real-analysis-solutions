	\section*{2.1 Bijections and Cardinality}
		Principle 2.1 (The bijection principle). Two sets have the same size if and only if there is a bijection between them.
		
	\section*{2.2 Counting Infinities}
		Theorem 2.8 ($|Z| = |Q|$). There are the same number of integers as rational numbers.
		
		Theorem 2.9 ($|R| > |N|$). There are more real numbers than natural numbers.
		
		Theorem 2.11 (Sizes of infinity). There are different sizes of infinity, with countable infinity being the smallest. Moreover, N, Z, and Q are countable while R is uncountable.
		
		Theorem 2.13 (|A| < |P(A)|). If A is a set and P(A) is the power set of A, then
		\begin{equation}
			|A| < |P(A)|
		\end{equation}
		
		Corollary 2.14 (There exist infinitely many infinities). There exist infinitely many distinct infinite cardinalities.
